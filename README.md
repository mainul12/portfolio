Collections of Data Science Projects

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and PDFs of data science projects in both Python and R programming language.

Each project has its own Jupyter notebook along with a PDF rendering. 

Broadly speaking the projects center around:
- statistical tests, 
- exercises in simulated data from different imagine scenarios, 
- running machine learning models on real and simulated datasets, 
- data cleaning and data visualization. 

Some projects are meant to emulate real world business scenarios and some are added to demonstrate conceptual understanding of various statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms. 

Both Python and R are used. Occassionally the Wolfram language is used too.
